## Minute Taker Notes

### 13:50 ->        Meeting started

### 13:50 -> 13:54|   Feedback from TA
We got some great feedback from TA on our team performance. She also stated some important notes:
"Make sure to review correctly the merge requests and other developers code. It's the reviewers
responsibility to make sure their code works properly!". She also added that we 
should make sure that everybody works on every technology part of the project and switch the roles regularly
and not have one person working on something consistently.
TA also stated that we'll receive feedbacks on our code on week4/5,
and she thinks we've done good so far :)
### 13:55 -> 14:00|   Showing project demo
Parham showed the demo of the graphics features implemented so far to the group.

### 14:00 -> 14:12|   Talking about technologies
Federico suggested to start getting familiar with all the technologies we need
like JPA, Javafx, Dependency Injection, ... by watching some tutorial videos.

### 14:12 -> 14:25| Discussing tasks and setting up a agenda for later weeks
A basic agenda for next weeks was set up, so we can have a good plan for next weeks:
- admin frontend and backend -> Until Week5

- server multi client implementation -> Until Week5

- Setup all the endpoints and database -> Until Week5
- Finish UI basic requirements like creating expense page and debt page -> Until Week5
- Language change feature -> Until Week6
- Email notification -> Until Week6 or 7
- Open debts feature -> Until Week6 or 7
- Detailed expenses feature -> Until Week7 or 8
- Currency change feature -> Until Week8 or 9
- Code testing -> alongside the work in each week


### 14:25 -> 14:30|  Wrap up
It was suggested that everybody understands different parts of the project by going through the code written in the other parts they were not involved in
before next meeting, like graphics, server, or any other part implemented so far.
Also team reminded Parham (minute taker) to submit available final version of code of conduct which was written last week on brightspace.


### 14:30| Meeting ended

### After the meeting discussions
It was agreed to come up with a user story document, so we put all the user stories there and from these stories
we create issues and milestones for this and next weeks on gitlab. For this task Federico, Manu and Teodor will scan
the backlog file and try to find the remaining to issues to add to gitlab by Wednesday.
Therefore this week's tasks will be defined and assigned on Wednesday.
