- There are no problems regarding GitLab.
- The team is ready for developing code/knows the git process.

Talking Point 2) - Code of Conduct
- Went through briefly each point of the Code of Conduct, explained its contents and verified if the team was in agreement.
- It was decided that:
  - Communication through Mattermost should mainly be from Minute Taker to TA.
  - Online Meetings will be set at 12:30 PM every Sunday.

- Brief overview of the classes was explained in order to model the database (Event, Participant, Expense, User, ...to 		be added).
- Agreed on no complex authentification
- The server can be accessed by everyone
- Admin/user should be different classes.


Talking Point 4) - Task Assignment.

Following the requirement of producing 100+ lines of code each, the team decided to modify the previously set tasks of the agend. Specifically, the team will be split into two sub-teams of three people each.

The first team (Federico Lentini, Parham Bateni, Yan Olerinskiy), is tasked to:
- Task 1: Develop checkstyle of the project to improve code quality. (Deadline - February 21st)
- Task 2: Develop the design of the application, through a software like figma. (Deadline - February 22nd)
- Task 3: Implement basic user flow of the application in JavaFX. (Deadline - February 24th)

The second team (Manu Looij, Teodor Damyanov, Adrian Slics), is tasked to:
- Task 4: Finalize and upload the Code of Conduct. (Deadline - February 22nd)
- Task 5: Model in a conceptual schema the Class/Database Design. (Deadline - February 22nd)
- Task 6: Implement java classes of the modeled entities. (Deadline - February 24th)

GOAL: Each sub-team is responsible to complete all assigned tasks within the agreed deadlines.
Each member of the team should contribute to non-coding tasks, coding tasks & code review (merge request).
