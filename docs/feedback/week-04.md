# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Very good.
Great agenda, you have good, relevant points of discussion. You can add some more details to some points; for example, you could explain briefly what you mean with "policies of functionality about debt".

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Very good.
Nice notes, nice that you also added some time stamps and concrete deadlines for the project. However, in the "Talking about technologies" section, you could've been more explicit by stating whether/where the tutorials mentioned will be shared.

#### Chair performance
Very good.
You followed the agenda and ensured that all the points were discussed. You could've asked your teammates for their opinions more when you saw that not everyone is saying something (= guiding the discussion). 

#### Attitude & Relation
Excellent.
You were all involved in the discussions, and you ensured that you listen to each other's opinions. Overall, the atmosphere was constructive and you had relevant discussions.

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Good.
You seem to be on track to successfully finishing your project. However, as most changes happened on the backend, I cannot easily compare the current state of your application to the one from last week. I suggest you to work on frontend and backend in parallel, so that you have new fully-functioning features every week.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Sufficient.
Regarding the meeting organization, it is great that you had a section in the meeting in which you discussed what you did last week, and this is the main reason you didn't get an insufficient here. Also, it feels like all of you contributed at least a bit to the project. However, it seems like these contributions were neither equal nor significant enough. Ideally, each one of you should make consistent contributions each week, and you shouldn't even be close to not fulfilling the knock-out criteria.
