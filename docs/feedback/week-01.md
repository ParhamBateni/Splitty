#### 1) Self-organization
Excellent.
The team self organized quite well. It took very little time to get out the laptops and the conversation points and get to work on them. I noticed also that the team actively involved everyone, by for example rephrasing a question that was asked to the group. The question was something like "does everyone know how to do xxx?" and after a neutral response, someone interjected with "does someone *not* know how to do xxx?". I thought that was very good. 


#### 2) Suggested Topics
Excellent.
All suggested topics were covered. You consistently looked back at the 'agenda' provided in the lecture slides and led yourselves. You even took minutes. To improve you might look at your time management more. An agenda with time stamps and a chair to look out for them will help a lot for this of course.
