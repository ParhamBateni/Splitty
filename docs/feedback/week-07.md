# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda
Excellent.
The agenda looks good, it contains relevant discussion topics and the estimated times make sense. Good job! 

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Excellent.
The notes are clear, follow the discussion and contain concrete agreements. Good job!

#### Chair performance
Excellent.
You covered the topics of the agenda for the expected time, and you ensured that topics are discussed at the right time. It is nice that you encouraged your teammates to give their opinions during the conversation. Good job!

#### Attitude & Relation
Good.
The atmosphere was generally constructive, and peopleâ€™s ideas were taken into account. It feels however like you were not as involved in the conversation as during previous meetings. 

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Very good.
You made some great improvements since last week. You should be on track to finish at least the basic requirements by the end of the course. Make sure to have things on main though.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Very good.
It seems like all of you contributed to the project. As before, I cannot clearly assess this just from the conversation.
