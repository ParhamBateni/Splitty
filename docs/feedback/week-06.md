# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Excellent.
Your agenda is good - it covers relevant topics and has timestamps that make sense. Good job!

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Excellent.
The notes are clear, cover what was discussed during the meeting, as well as the agreements you decided on. The agreements are concrete and can be achieved. Good job!

#### Chair performance
Very good.
You covered all the points on the agenda for the appropriate amount of time. You guided the discussion nicely and you asked people for their approval. You could have asked more for people’s opinions when you observed that they were not saying much, but there was no point in which there was an obvious need for your intervention, so it’s not a big deal. Good job!

#### Attitude & Relation
Excellent.
The atmosphere was generally constructive. Everyone contributed to the discussion at least a bit and people’s opinions were taken into account. Good job!

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Good.
You have a nice UI, new features and you are on track to finish your project until the end of the course. You said that some of your features are currently not on main - try to merge them to main before the meeting.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Excellent.
From what I’ve heard during the meeting, it seems like all of you are involved in the project and doing your tasks. Keep it up!
