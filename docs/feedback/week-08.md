# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Excellent.
Your agenda looks good and clear, and includes relevant talking points. The time estimates also make sense.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Very good.
Your minutes follow the discussion and are quite clear. They do not contain many agreements and conclusions, but the discussion itself did not contain many either.

#### Chair performance
Good.
You guided the discussion well. Even though you didn’t fully follow the agenda, it makes sense given the fact that you had to change it during the meeting to include discussing the feedback. You brought up discussion points and considered your teammates’ opinions.

#### Attitude & Relation
Very good.
All of you contributed to the discussion and listened to each other’s opinions. Good job!

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Good.
You made some nice progress since last week’s version. You should be able to finish at least the basic requirements on time.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Very good.
From what I’ve heard, it seems like all of you are contributing to the project. Take this with a grain of salt though, as I only base my assessment on what was said during the meeting.
