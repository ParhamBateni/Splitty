# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Excellent.
Your agenda followed the template and contained relevant points of discussion for this week. All the discussion points were clearly specified and contained subpoints if necessary, which is great for guiding the meeting and allowing the team to prepare. Also, the expected time spent on each item fit very well the actual amount of time you needed to have a constructive discussion on the topic and reach an at least partial conclusion. Great job, keep it up!

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Excellent.
The notes are clear, specific, and follow the agenda (and, thus, the discussion flow of the meeting). Each talking point has several bullet points corresponding to it, which cover the ideas brought up during the meeting. The agreements reached during the meeting are concrete and clear. Again, good job, keep it up!

#### Chair performance
Excellent.
You guided the meeting well. You ensured that all the topics of the agenda were covered for the appropiate amount of time, and you ensured that for each talking point the discussion stayed constructive. You made sure that others' opinions were heard, while still keeping the discussion focused. Great job!

#### Attitude & Relation
Excellent.
You did a great job at conducting this meeting yourselves. Everyone was actively participating and stating their opinions, which is great not only for the evolution of the project, but also for avoiding "group think" (when everyone agrees with a suggested idea - it hinders progress). The atmosphere was constructive - each talking point was paired with a discussion that actually had a purpose and reached a conclusion. Also, it was nice that sometimes, if someone showed the intention to say something but the discussion continued, you stopped to ask for that person's opinion. Great job!

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Excellent.
It was great that you included showing me your current state of the application in the meeting. Even though it was the first week of actual coding, you made good progress. You are on track to create a good, working final application, so keep it up!

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Sufficient.
From the discussion about the current state of the application, it seems like all of you are contributing to the team's goals. However, there wasn't a very explicit discussion about what each one of you did last week, and if you managed to complete your tasks. It would be great to include a small section during the meeting in which you take short turns (~20-30 seconds) explaining what you did the previous sprint. Also, it feels like last week the topics (frontend vs. backend) of the tasks were not that equally distributed, but as long as you switch around every week it should be fine. In short: have a small section in the meeting for last week's contributions and make sure they are as equal (in terms of both topics and weights) as possible.
