# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There were a chair and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Good.
Your agenda looks generally good, and the way you organized it makes sense. However, it would help to detail what each talking point entails. For example, when you expect to spend 10 minutes talking about the Code of Conduct, what exactly do you plan to discuss? 

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
N/A

#### Chair performance
Very good.
One one hand, you guided the discussion nicely, you asked for your teammates' opinions, and you touched on almost all the points on the agenda. On the other hand, you didn't really follow the agenda closely enough. For future meetings, I suggest you to try to spend on each point of the agenda roughly the amount of time allocated to it, and to avoid skipping over some of the points. 

#### Attitude & Relation
Excellent.
Everyone actively contributed to the discussion, and you considered everyone's opinion. It was nice that when you observed that how much you talked was not really equal, you tried to explicitly include everyone in the conversation. However, sometimes when you asked for others' opinions, you didn't give that much time for a response. In such cases, you should try to wait a few more seconds for an answer.

#### Potentially Shippable Product
N/A

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Excellent
There was not a lot to do for the project this week, but you seem to participate equally much in the conversation and the Code of Conduct. For next weeks, try to continue contributing equally :)
