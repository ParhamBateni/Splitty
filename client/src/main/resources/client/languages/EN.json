However if using gmail you would have to create a special app password that is required because of security concerns. \nTo do so go to the security page of your gmail account, then you need to enable 2-step verification, if you already have or when you have done it head to its page and scroll to the bottom of it. There you find a menu to create an app password, in that menu you need to choose a name for the app and then you will be given the app password. Use this password instead of your standard email one.",
